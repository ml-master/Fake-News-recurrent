An inquest (i.e., a legal investigation into her death) was held on 21 January 2014. During this proceeding, a pathologist provided his opinion that cannabis \u201ccaused [Moss\u2019s] death.\u201d The testimony that inspired that pathologist\u2019s interpretation, however, was a bit more vague than the  specific claim of cannabis \u201cpoisoning\u201d, based on a longer account of the proceedings published by the UK\u2019s more respectable  newspaper:The phrase \u201cthe effects of cannabis\u201d leaves room for presuming an indirect relationship between Moss\u2019s death and cannabis (i.e., one that would not be considered a \u201cpoisoning\u201d). In captions attached to some of the photographs, and in a sidebar, the  seems to suggest a heart attack triggered by cannabis \u2014 an entirely different claim than the one expressed in their headline \u2014 might have been the cause of Moss\u2019s death:Perhaps unintentionally, then, the article presents two conflicting hypotheses that require investigation: 1) Is it possible to consume enough cannabis that you are directly poisoned by its toxicity?; and 2) Is it possible for marijuana to trigger a (fatal) heart attack?There is a near universal agreement on the answer to this question: No. While no studies designed to ascertain a lethal dose level for THC \u2014 the primary psychoactive component of cannabis \u2014 have been undertaken on humans, a number of animal studies suggest that THC\u2019s potential toxicity is remarkably low.Such studies seek to address what concentration of a chemical causes a lethal reaction in 50% of population of test subjects, known as the LD. A study performed in the 1970s (whose results are described here) attempted to determine this value in a variety of rodent, dog, and monkey populations:In other words, scientists were literally unable to intentionally cause fatal toxicity from cannabis in both dogs and primates. This lack of lethality was famously put into perspective by an oft-cited 1972 report issued by President Nixon\u2019s \u201cNational Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse\u201d (The Shafer Commission), a group whose findings the Nixon administration ultimately ignored:While higher potency of marijuana would change that math a bit, it would not change it enough for that amount of combustion and inhalation to be possible. A 2011 report on drug abuse from the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) states that there had been (at least at that time), zero documented cases of fatal overdoses from cannabis.If cannabis killed Gemma Moss, it would had to have done so through a mechanism other than direct toxicity.That cannabis affects the cardiovascular system is uncontroversial. A 2001 study published in the journal  reviewed the most significant interactions between cannabis and the heart:To see if these effects contributed to the incidence of heart attacks, researchers surveyed 3882 patients who had suffered heart attacks, asking them to recall when they had most recently smoked marijuana (if at all) prior to their heart attacks. The investigation concluded that:As well, a variety of case reports at least hint at the fact that marijuana could increase the risk of heart attacks in users who already exhibit other risk factors. The question is, however, whether marijuana could cause a heart attack on its own (i.e., in the absence of these risk factors or other contributory causes). To date, the answer to this question remains controversial, but most research suggests that other risk factors need to be present for cannabis use to be a trigger for a heart attack.While we allow it is technically possible that cannabis could have contributed to Gemma Moss\u2019s death, as suggested by a pathologist and some news accounts, it is important to note that \u2014 based on the \u2019s own reporting \u2014 Moss exhibited no signs of a heart attack or any other form of organ failure.The only evidence presented linking Moss\u2019s death to cannabis was the fact that she was found dead next to a half-smoked joint, and that her bloodstream showed that she had consumed marijuana. Nearly any other suggested cause for her sudden death would be, from an evidentiary standpoint, as valid as the pathologist\u2019s claim that it was likely from marijuana.Yes, the most plausible way for cannabis to have contributed to Moss\u2019s death would have been through some sort of cardiovascular event, but research suggests that such an event would be extremely rare (if not impossible) in the absence of other risk factors. Numerous other non-marijuana-related causes of cardiac arrest also appear to have been excluded without investigation.The fact of the matter is that unexplained, sudden deaths occasionally strike down healthy individuals. The absence of a clear explanation for a death should not compel acceptance of a scientifically implausible one, however. In our view, death from direct cannabis toxicity is unlikely, as this event is generally viewed to be medically impossible. The incidence of a heart attack as a contributing factor in the case of death that is not otherwise fully explainable is certainly a possibility, but the notion that smoking half a joint would trigger a fatal heart attack in a person who did not exhibit any existing cardiovascular disease strains credulity.

(Were these personal donations? Did he collect items from supporters? Did the campaign pay for them?)

A CNN report also noted that Trump had donated blankets and school supplies.In addition to questioning the contents of Trump\u2019s donation, some were skeptical that the candidate had donated anything at all, claiming that Trump merely helped to\u00a0unload a truck of supplies donated by another organization.

For others, it\u2019s an excuse\u00a0to deflect the shared blame for the institution of slavery in America away from white people.In the latter vein, a \u201c9 Facts About Slavery They Don\u2019t Want You to Know\u201d meme lays\u00a0out\u00a0a mixture of true, false and misleading historical claims. We\u2019ll address each one in turn below:Possibly true. The wording of the statement is important. Anthony Johnson was not the first slave owner in American history, but he was, according to historians,  the first to have his lifetime ownership of a servant legally sanctioned\u00a0by a court.\u00a0A former indentured servant himself, Anthony Johnson was a \u201cfree negro\u201d who owned a 250-acre farm in Virginia during the 1650s, with\u00a0five indentured servants\u00a0under contract to\u00a0him. One of them, a black man named John Casor, claimed that his term of service\u00a0had expired years earlier and Johnson was holding him\u00a0illegally. In 1654, a civil court found that Johnson in fact owned Casor\u2019s services for life, an outcome historian R Halliburton Jr. calls \u201cone of the first known legal sanctions of slavery\u00a0\u2014 other than as a punishment for crime.\u201dFalse. William Ellison was a very wealthy black plantation owner and cotton gin manufacturer\u00a0who\u00a0lived\u00a0in South Carolina (not North Carolina). According to the 1860 census (in which his surname was listed as \u201cEllerson\u201d), he owned 63 black slaves, making him the largest of the 171\u00a0 slaveholders in South Carolina, but far from the largest overall slave holder in the state.True. Historian Tiya Miles provided this snapshot of the Native American ownership of black slaves at the turn of the 19th century for\u00a0\u00a0magazine in January 2016:Approximately true, according to historian R. Halliburton Jr.:Somewhat\u00a0true. There were exceptions, but generally speaking \u2014\u00a0especially after 1750, by which time slave codes had been\u00a0entered into the law books in most of the American colonies \u2014\u00a0black slaves were not legally permitted\u00a0to own property or businesses. From the\u00a0 (2002):True, in the sense that the phenomenon\u00a0of human beings enslaving other human beings goes back thousands of years, but not just among blacks, and not just in Africa.Sort of true. Historian Steven Mintz describes the situation more accurately in the introduction to his book\u00a0:True, as noted above \u2014\u00a0though how \u201ccommon\u201d slavery has been and what the specific nature of that slavery was has varied according to time and place.It\u2019s rather self-serving to claim that \u201cwhite people\u201d ended legal chattel slavery in the United States (much less ended chattel slavery, period), given that the overwhelming majority of blacks in the U.S. could not vote, could not run for political office, and, in every other way conceivable, were excluded from institutional power. Moreover, even as some white people were laboring to put an end to slavery, many others were fighting to preserve it.Slavery was eliminated in America via the efforts of people of various ethnicities, including Caucasians, who took up the banner of the abolitionist movement. The names of the white leaders of that movement tend to be better known than those of the black leaders, among whom were David Walker, Frederick Douglass, Dred Scott, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Nat Turner, and many others.

The scenario imagined above involves a thief\u2019s standing outside of a locked door and waiting for it to be unlocked before barging in \u2014 but hanging around the porch of a house waiting some indeterminate amount of time for the door to be unlocked is an awfully conspicuous and inefficient break-in method, and it isn\u2019t much facilitated by the use of a rubber band (since the would-be thief could simply hold the latch handle down with his thumb instead). And how is this method any easier or faster or more furtive than just knocking on the door and pushing it wide open once the resident answers it?Kim\u2019s post also claimed that this style of home invasion has been \u201chappening all of a sudden,\u201d but we were unable to uncover any news reports involving a similar scheme.\u00a0While a specific location wasn\u2019t mentioned in the\u00a0original message\u00a0(which was shared more than 100,000 times within a few days of its initial posting) Kim\u2019s response in the comments section mentioned Tatum, Texas, and stated that this was also happening in Bossier, Louisiana:Yet we found no warnings issued by the\u00a0Tatum Police Department\u00a0or the Bossier Sheriff Department regarding rubber bands and home invasions.Lastly, the bulk of Kim\u2019s post had more to do with guns and a general mistrust of strangers (who could conceivably barge in through an exterior door any time you opened it, rubber bands or no rubber bands) than it had to do with a specific home invasion technique. It\u2019s possible people were confusing the combination of rubber band and door lock with other more effective techniques for defeating locks (such as the ones linked above), and/or that the placement of a rubber band shown here was unrelated to any potential criminal activity (i.e., it was just used to hold a brochure or newspaper that blew away or was removed by someone else).We reached out to\u00a0Kim Fleming Cernigliaro (as well as the aforementioned police departments) for more information with no response, but it appears that this Facebook message employed a fictional scenario in order to spread a general message encouraging caution when opening doors to strangers.", "true_details": [["First , a thief be go to need to target your home , specifically .", 68.751, 0, 74], ["With home invasion occur so frequently , it 's normal to want to take extra measure to ensure the safety of your family .", 67.054, 0, 97], ["The way it work be a bit involved , but here it be in a nutshell :\nAccording to the story , the robber attach a rubber band to your door latch , thereby sort of hold it in the `` open '' position .", 66.156, 1, 28], ["Not only be have a bunch of flyer or sticker stick in your door a nuisance , it can also serve a a way for burglar to mark your home .", 66.008, 0, 81], ["The whole point be that this happen while you be home , so it 's unclear how you would see the rubber band from the inside anyway .", 65.085, 0, 10], ["Any product that promise to protect your home deserve a heightened level of scrutiny , so it be n't surprising that you 'll find plenty of strong opinion about the potential vulnerability of popular home-security system .", 63.547, 0, 80], ["At the end of the day , home security system be primarily design to protect against the sort of opportunistic smash-and-grab attack that make up the majority of burglary .", 63.483, 0, 73], ["It be an invasion of your space and sense of safety .", 59.408, 0, 94], ["There be an increase number of YouTube video show people how to remove a keloid scar - a raise blister-like scar which can form at the site of even minor cut .", 59.389, 0, 114], ["Here be a few idea :\nWhether you maintain your home surveillance system or it 's monitor around the clock by a professional security team , it 's important to have your camera professionally instal for the best lifetime performance .", 58.99, 0, 145]], "false_details": [["Home security specialist Yale warn that crook have be use outside bin to mark home as well , often by slap a sticker on the side of a bin outside a prime target .", 34.0, 0, 127], ["This week , it emerge that would-be thief have be leave strip of sellotape over front door keyhole to find out whether the occupant be on holiday .", 31.603, 0, 134], ["In fact , ladybug home invasion be quite common in the fall accord to Kristine Braman and retire USDA entomologist Louis Tedders .", 31.372, 0, 105], ["In the tutorial people be see wrap a rubber band tightly around the keloid , cut off the blood supply to the affected area .", 30.081, 0, 112], ["The wide majority of the rest be unlawful , unforced entry that result from something like a window or a garage door be leave open .", 29.698, 0, 77], ["The burglar in this particular study do not come to a clear consensus on whether lighting be a sufficient deterrent : `` Responses be mixed regard light on in a home .", 29.536, 0, 104], ["`` Marks can also be use to flag up home which be empty during the day or unoccupied for long period of time .

The athletic event was considered a time when adversaries in the Cold War could openly compete for dominance on the world stage. Though global borders and economies have been redrawn in the decades since, the Russians still face allegations of doping in the .Rumors that girls as young as 14 and women athletes were intentionally impregnated by coaches or trainers with the intent of terminating those pregnancies for a physical gain have their origins in these Cold War politics, and therefore come with an air of believability that appears to have lent them undue credit.Since at least 1956, Western media outlets have leveled accusations against Soviet bloc countries that female Olympic athletes sometimes use a terminated pregnancy to reap hormonal and physiological benefits, according to a 1994 report in UK\u2019s :\u00a0Media reports leveled similar charges at other communist nations as well, most notably East Germany. A 1988 article, reported on from East Berlin,  these rumors as \u201cfueled by the Western European press.\u201dIn 1994, German media provided what they billed as a confirmation of both this practice\u2019s existence and its sponsorship by a governmental organization. In a story that garnered widespread Western coverage, the German television station RTL aired what they presented as an interview with a Soviet gymnast named In a perplexing twist, however, Kovalenko disputes that she was the person who appeared in that interview, claiming the network interviewed an imposter. She additionally disputes an interview attributed to her in a Russian newspaper where she allegedly confirmed details of abortion doping to a reporter there. With regard to the latter, Kovalenko won a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper in Russian court in 1998, and she threatened a lawsuit against the German television outlet as well, as reported by Agence France Presse on 10 December 1998:Karasyova\u2019s disputed testimony remains the only \u201cconfirmation\u201d of the practice of abortion doping. Despite her legal victory, the interviews attributed to her have been repeated as fact  Karasyova won her court battle. It\u2019s unclear whether she attempted to make similar claims against the German television show.Karsyova\u2019s alleged 1994 interview carried additional weight when it was first reported because many reporters suggested, during the 1968 Olympics, the only way silver medalist gymnast \u2014a Czech with anti-Soviet views and a favorite of Western media\u2014could have lost was if Karasyova had cheated.Caslavska\u2019s coach is actually the source of a quote often presented to support the notion that \u201cabortion doping\u201d is a real practice. Responding to the 1994 RTL interview, her coach says \u201cIn any other country it would have been called rape.\u201d This quote, while  as independent proof of the practice, refers the same disputed incident.can be traced to a February 2002  published in the  Canadian independent newspaper . The author, Celeste McGovern, is well-known for pushing medical conspiracies and is occasionally  on fringe websites like InfoWars. Her sparsely sourced story ran with this shocking :This story, written in the run-up to the 2002 Winter Olympics, raised anew the spectre of this supposedly hushed form of performance enhancement, suggesting it has been a common practice. The article\u2019s most significant claims have been cited or referenced in myriad pro-life , a , and at least one :The first source McGovern cites is the director of an anti-abortion group in Texas who then, in turn, cites an unnamed \u201cFinnish sports medicine expert\u201d about its widespread use.The expert, based on his \u201cfavourite way of getting an edge\u201d quote, is a doctor named Risto Erkola, who  both his disgust at the practice and the claim that it was widespread in a 22 May 1988 article in the British tabloid . His quote has been repeated ad infinitum in .Media reports following this tabloid claim were skeptical of it, and it is not clear if Erkola would have had any first-hand knowledge of Soviet doping practices in the first place. Responding to the  claims in a report that appeared in numerous papers including a 25 May 1988 article in Australian paper  [pg 6, \u201cPregnancy Improves Performance, Says Doctor\u201d], Peter Larkins, then an official of the Australian Sports Medicine Association raised both scientific skepticism and an eagerness to believe the rumors in spite of that skepticism:The latter source in McGovern\u2019s  story, a second-hand report of a \u201cRussian athlete\u201d about gymnasts \u201cas young as 14\u201d being ordered to sleep with their coaches is a nearly word-for-word description of news reports concerning the disputed 1994 interview with a potential imposter. As such it almost certainly refers to the same dubious case.McGovern omits the fact that this later testimony was refuted by its alleged source, and suggests a man quoted in a 1988 article with no clear connection to the Soviet Union as an authority of its widespread use. Despite these factual problems, McGovern\u2019s  report has been, and continues to be, cited as evidence of the practice.The scientific rationale in favor of abortion doping is similarly self-referential, circumstantial, and problematic. In a post promoting McGovern\u2019s 2002 report on abortion doping, anti-abortion website LifeSiteNews.com  their own bit of research, which is repeated verbatim on many other similar sites:However, this so-called textbook is an online, self-published document that contains  for its claims regarding abortion doping, and largely repeats information contained in the aforementioned press accounts attributed to a potential imposter of Karasyova.Another oft-repeated bit of supporting data has its origins in another  report \u2014 this one . In a story about cheating in sports, the  cites a Michigan State University professor as lending credibility to the scientific basis of abortion doping:We reached out to Pivarnik for verification. He told us via email that he does not remember conveying the stats cited to the , and that the numbers were \u201cnothing new.\u201d But the numbers were not targeted toward a discussion about athletic performance enhancement. Pivarnik told us he had \u201cno idea\u201d which study of his the was referring to.No published studies have specifically tested a performance benefit following terminated pregnancies.That does not mean there is nothing to the claim. It is well known, as Pivarnik stated, that a woman\u2019s blood volume increases  to support a fetus. The notion that hormonal changes could lead to benefits, while theoretical, is not completely without biological basis. The basic concept, as reported in  is  in principles about how pregnancy works:\u201cThis is just a theory,\u201d Pivarnik cautioned in that  piece.On top of these theories, media reports also frequently  elite athletes\u2019 success \u2014documented in the case of some elite athletes and a popular topic on the web\u2014to the the theoretical benefits of abortion-doping. The role of giving birth and finding success as an Olympian is disputed. Regardless, giving birth is significantly different than terminating a pregnancy after 3 months.\u201cAbortion doping\u201d claims, specifically, have their roots in Cold War era rumors, are confirmed only by a single dubious case, are buttressed by speculative science, and are largely amplified in recent years by anti-abortion groups.We cannot, however, conclusively prove or disprove the existence of covert athletic research or practices allegedly performed by countries behind the Iron Curtain.

Gavin Newsom on Sept. 14, 2020, while visiting the state to view damage and meet with officials.\nAt least 35 people have died, and millions of acres have burned in wildfires ranging from California to Washington in late summer 2020 which have blanketed the entire region in smoke.\nAlthough the historic wildfires were fueled by a variety of causes and conditions \u2014 including dry lightning strikes, downed power lines, and in the case of the El Dorado fire in California, a pyrotechnic device launched during a gender reveal party \u2014 experts say that climate change likely exacerbated them.\nNotably, Elisabeth K\u00f6stinger, the Austrian Federal Minister of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism, refuted Trump\u2019s claims that Austrians reside in \u201cforest cities\u201d in a piece published by British newspaper The Independent.\n\u201cYou will find no \u2018forest cities\u2019 in Austria,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou will find habitats closely intertwined with forests.\u201d\u00a0\nShe also emphasized that while Austria doesn\u2019t have exploding trees, the country has learned to sustainably co-exist with nature so that natural habitats can flourish:\nTo clarify: No, we don\u2019t have any exploding trees in Austria! Even though Austria is densely populated, we have found a way to give our trees the space they need as well as a sustainable future while still making use of what they produce. And yes, when President Trump mentions that our forests have been \u201ctidied up\u201d, he is right. In order to create a beautiful, safe and biodiverse environment, you have to look after it. All kinds of pests, especially bark beetles, have the capacity to destroy the hard work of generations of foresters and forest farmers while at the same time increasing the risk of wildfires massively.\nHere is video of Trump\u2019s comments on Fox & Friends:", "true_details": [["The sky be on fire , for Christ 's sake , and only one of the two candidate think it 's about more than explode tree .", 63.282, 0, 48], ["Q Mr. President , what role do you think climate change play in the fire we \u2019 re see here ?", 61.67, 0, 154], ["He tell Mr. Trump , `` We want to work with you to really recognize the change climate , and what it mean to our forest .

I asked them if they were going to sell back the blue and they said no not at this time. This is a shame and they will no longer have me as a customer.\u201d\n\nThose claims contained a mixture of truth and falsehood. Kohl\u2019s did announce, on Sept. 7, 2020, that it had collaborated with a local business near the company\u2019s headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to produce \u201ca line of tees for the whole family to support racial equality\u201d:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve partnered with Cream City Print Lounge, a Milwaukee-area Black-owned business, to create a line of tees for the whole family to support racial equality. Mark your calendars for 9/21 to shop the line in select stores and at\u00a0Kohls.com.\u00a0With this launch, Kohl\u2019s is proud to donate $100,000 to the\u00a0The National Urban League, which strengthens economic empowerment, equity and civil rights.\u201d\n\nThe T-shirts themselves do not appear to feature the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or \u201cBLM.\u201d A spokesperson for Kohl\u2019s told Snopes the clothing would not feature the name of the movement itself and clarified, \u201cThe collection is not affiliated with the Black Lives Matter organization.\u201d\nPhotographs of some of the T-shirts being printed, which were posted on Facebook by local reporter Cassidy Williams, featured the slogans \u201cBlack culture is not a trend\u201d and \u201cRacism is not cool\u201d as well as the raised fist symbol, which has been used as a symbol of \u201cunity and solidarity\u201c, the BLM movement, and as a symbol of \u201cBlack power.\u201d\nThe T-shirt shown in the Kohl\u2019s announcement on Sept. 7 also featured the same \u201craised fist\u201d symbol with the words \u201cJustice, Respect, Change.\u201d On Facebook, Cream City Print Lounge advertised a launch party for its collaboration with Kohl\u2019s, and the graphic for the event featured T-shirts bearing the slogans \u201cBlack culture is not a trend,\u201d \u201cTogether we can create change,\u201d \u201cPeace, love, equality,\u201d and the raised fist with \u201cJustice, Respect, Change\u201d \u2014 but again, rather conspicuously, no T-shirts bearing the name \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or \u201cBLM.\u201d\nAs a result, it\u2019s hard to argue that it would be more accurate to describe the forthcoming Kohl\u2019s line as \u201cBLM T-shirts,\u201d rather than \u201cT-shirts advocating racial equality.\u201d Anti-racism is not synonymous with the BLM movement, and vice versa, just as anti-racist rhetoric and symbolism should not be conflated with, or reduced to, the slogan \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d And in this case, the company happens to have made that distinction explicit.\u00a0\nFurthermore, the political and social atmosphere that prevailed in the United States in the autumn of 2020 was one of intense and widespread division surrounding acts of police violence towards Black people and resulting protests. The BLM movement, in general, and the Black Lives Matter Global Network in particular, were the subject of a great deal of criticism, especially among right-leaning observers and supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump. So the distinction between \u201cBLM T-shirts\u201d and \u201cT-shirts advocating racial equality\u201d could hardly have been more substantive.\u00a0\nNonetheless, the description of the T-shirts as \u201cBLM merchandise\u201d was clearly not arbitrary, and obvious areas of overlap existed between the principles and messages advocated by the broader BLM movement, on the one hand, and the collaboration between Kohl\u2019s and Cream City Print Lounge.

News organizations quoted this particular section from Facebook\u2019s music guidelines:\nYou may not use videos on our Products to create a music listening experience\nWe want you to be able to enjoy videos posted by family and friends. However, if you use videos on our Products to create a music listening experience for yourself or for others, your videos will be blocked and your page, profile or group may be deleted.

But the vagueness of the term, \u201cmusic listening experience\u201d resulted in rumors that were far from the truth.\nWe learned that the above guidelines were not new. They had been in place since at least 2018, based on the archived version of the same page.\nOn Sept. 11, 2020, Facebook issued a clarification to a May 20, 2020, blog post titled \u201cUpdates and Guidelines for Including Music in Video.\u201d They stated:\nWe want to encourage musical expression on our platforms while also ensuring that we uphold our agreements with rights holders. These agreements help protect the artists, songwriters, and partners who are the cornerstone of the music community \u2014 and we\u2019re grateful for how they\u2019ve enabled the amazing creativity we\u2019ve seen in this time.\nOur partnerships with rights holders have brought people together around music on our platforms. As part of our licensing agreements, there are limitations around the amount of recorded music that can be included in Live broadcasts or videos.\nWe reached out to Facebook, and a spokesperson confirmed that their music guidelines had been in place since 2018. Social media users were mistaking the updates they made to their terms of service for new music guidelines \u2014 but there were no new updates to the music guidelines, including a supposed ban on livestreaming music. The spokesperson pointed us to the same blog post that highlighted what was, and was not, permitted:\nBased on the information in the blog post, Facebook is still permitting live musical performances \u2014 but with limitations. Those include shorter clips, and cutting back on full-length recordings. They noted that these guidelines \u201care consistent across live and recorded video on both Facebook and Instagram, and for all types of accounts.\u201d A Facebook spokesperson pointed out what some of these limitations could be:\nAlthough music is launched on our platforms in more than 90 countries, there are places where it is not yet available. So if your video includes recorded music, it may not be available for use in those locations.\nPeople have access to a library of custom music and sound effects at no cost using Facebook\u2019s Sound Collection. The Sound Collection includes thousands of tracks available to use in the videos you share on Facebook and Instagram without any limits \u2013 spanning genres like hip hop, pop, jazz, country, and more.\nGiven that Facebook is not actually banning musical performances on its platforms, including through livestreams, but is continuing to implement old policies that have limitations based on copyright agreements, we rate this claim as \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "true_details": [["These policy have actually be in place since 2018 , but what Facebook be try to do be clarify what they mean by a \u201c listening experience.", 79.418, 1, 108], ["There be so much misinformation and so many misleading headline about Facebook \u2019 s change to \u201c listen experience \u201d happen on October 1st , so I want to help clarify .", 68.356, 1, 107], ["\u201d They say DJs should play short clip instead of full song , and even then , \u201c record audio should not be the primary purpose of your video.", 64.806, 0, 113], ["The novel coronavirus have shutter live music for the foreseeable future , physical medium sale be drop like an anchor , and nobody seem to know when some semblance of \u201c normalcy \u201d will be possible .", 64.707, 0, 6], ["The novel coronavirus have shutter live music for the foreseeable future , physical medium sale be drop like an anchor , and nobody seem to know when some semblance of \u201c normalcy \u201d will be possible .", 64.707, 0, 15], ["Within the guideline , it be state that user be not permit to use video to \u201c create a listening experience.", 64.638, 1, 87], ["The full guideline go on to describe scenario where ban be likely to be enforce , but the message be clear : Facebook be for share with family and friend , not for share music \u2013 unless you happen to be big enough to get an exception to the rule for your commercial enterprise .", 63.882, 1, 52], ["Why it matter : In respective company post , Instagram and Facebook say that social distancing have \u201c highlight some confusion across the community \u2014 especially around the use of recorded music in Live on both Facebook and Instagram .", 61.035, 1, 122], [", film an artist or band perform live ) be permit , \u201d it say , a it go on to clarify that what it \u2019 s try to do be squash livestreamers who simply play record in sequence or who use entire record song to enhance their video .", 59.93, 0, 100], ["As well , there should \u201c always be a visual component to your video \u201d and record music \u201c should not be the primary purpose of the video .", 58.666, 1, 89]], "false_details": [["What \u2019 s really happen be that Facebook strike a bunch of new license deal with music right holder , both label and publisher , as well a aggregator represent self-released artist .", 37.634, 0, 80], ["The novel coronavirus have shutter live music for the foreseeable future , physical medium sale be drop like an anchor , and nobody seem to know when some semblance of \u201c normalcy \u201d will be possible .", 36.735, 0, 6], ["The novel coronavirus have shutter live music for the foreseeable future , physical medium sale be drop like an anchor , and nobody seem to know when some semblance of \u201c normalcy \u201d will be possible .", 36.735, 0, 15], ["If you \u2019 re a DJ or cover artist , solely rely on facebook , this be go to be devastate .", 30.77, 0, 40], [", film an artist or band perform live ) be permitted.\u2022 The great the number of full-length record track in a video , the more likely it may be limit ( more below on what we mean by `` limited '' ) .\u2022 Shorter clip of music be recommended.\u2022 There should always be a visual component to your video ;

In less than two weeks, the fire spread to swallow more than 19,000 acres across San Bernardino and Riverside counties, per the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). On Sept. 18, authorities announced a firefighter died battling the blaze.\n\nThe Facebook post read as follows: \u201cA single gender-reveal party in California has caused more property damage than all the 2020 [Black Lives Matter] protests combined,\u201d referring to protests in cities nationwide against police use of excessive or deadly force against Black Americans, such as George Floyd.\u00a0\n\nWe should note here: The demonstrations against police brutality varied in intensity in 2020, including some peaceful marches organized by Black Lives Matter (BLM) leaders as well as some chaotic scenes of people breaking into businesses, stealing, and setting fires at night. That said, it is inaccurate to define \u201cBLM protests\u201d as only the latter \u2014 gatherings of unlawful behavior \u2014 but for the purpose of this report, we only considered demonstrations that did result in property damage, considering the wording of the claim.\nAdditionally, discussions about property damage caused by 2020 protests was a flashpoint in the country\u2019s political divide in the lead up to the November presidential election, with some high-profile Democrats urging peaceful protests instead to call attention to deep-rooted racism within American society. Meanwhile, conservatives led by U.S. President Donald Trump blamed the destruction by protesters on \u201cLiberal Governors and Mayors\u201d and believed it would intensify in suburban and rural areas unless voters reelected him.\nPosts like the one above seemed to be an attempt to counter the president\u2019s position by arguing that property damage caused by protesters paled in comparison to the destruction of the California wildfire. Below, however, we point out the holes in that argument and show why it makes a false comparison.\nFirstly, to unpack the claim, we considered its wording: the viral post did not mention general destruction or damage caused by either the fire or protests, nor injuries or deaths, but rather \u201cproperty damage,\u201d specifically. That meant we did not consider acres burned by the wildfire, or injuries or deaths caused by either the fire or demonstrations, to measure the validity of the post.\nNext, for our analysis, we referred to Cornell Law School\u2019s law dictionary, which defines property damage as any \u201cinjury to real or personal property through another\u2019s negligence, willful destruction, or by an act of nature,\u201d such as damage to vehicles, fences, homes, or any other possession. We used that definition for our investigation.\nAfter that, we researched fire authorities\u2019 investigation into the Yucaipa-area fire that started at a gender reveal party, which they have dubbed the \u201cEl Dorado\u201d fire. On Sept. 5, surveillance video apparently recorded a couple with several children walking into a grassy area while another person lit a device, Capt. Bennet Milloy of CAL FIRE told CNN. After the device ignites, the video reportedly showed the family scrambling and grabbing water bottles to try to douse flames, per Milloy.\nThen, we considered the numerous wildfires sweeping California in addition to the El Dorado fire. As of this writing, California firefighters were battling a total of 14 wildfires spanning more than 2.5 million acres, per CAL FIRE. The El Dorado wildfire was the fourth smallest among them, and firefighters had contained roughly 66% of it via man-made barriers, roads, or bodies of water.\nTotal, California fires in 2020 damaged or destroyed 6,292 properties \u2014 including barns, garages, homes, businesses, and industrial buildings, per the state agency.\nBut the El Dorado Fire, to which the claim referred, wrecked or destroyed 16 structures on its own. The San Bernardino Sun reported: \u201cTwelve people have been injured in the fire that has destroyed four homes and damaged two others, as well as several outbuildings.\u201d\nNext, we sought evidence that could quantify property damage during BLM protests nationwide since the start of the year. Per a map of demonstrations based on news reports and social media posts compiled by Alex Smith, a Geographic information Systems (GIS) analyst in Tuscan, Arizona, almost 4,500 cities globally hosted such protests in 2020, covering every U.S. state.\nAmong them was Minnesota, where thousands of people took to the streets in Minneapolis and St. Paul, for example, after the death of Floyd \u2014 a Black resident who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for about nine minutes during a 911 call to investigate a counterfeit $20 bill. For days, peaceful marches during the day were followed by vandalism and destruction at night, causing millions of dollars in property damage in more than 1,500 locations, per local news reports.\nAccording to The Star Tribune, which crowdsourced stories of the destruction, the damaged properties included more than 260 restaurants, 200 stores, 80 grocery stores, 50 homes across the Twin Cities (see the full list here), as well as the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s 3rd Precinct headquarters, which sustained heavy fire damage. The newspaper reported:\nThe Midtown Global Market area experienced one of the most concentrated tolls during the Floyd riots. More than a dozen businesses near E. Lake Street and Chicago Avenue were destroyed by fire, and a few dozen more reported fire damage with many being burned severely.\nIn other words, the number of properties or vehicles damaged in connection to BLM protests in Minneapolis alone was almost 100 times greater than that destroyed by the El Dorado fire.\nMinneapolis was not the only city where residents destroyed buildings by fires or flooding, broke windows, damaged cars or vandalized storefronts after police shot a Black community member in summer 2020. In Atlanta, Georgia, for example, protesters burned down a Wendy\u2019s restaurant, where police fatally shot Rayshard Brooks.\u00a0And in Kenosha, Wisconsin, protesters damaged or destroyed buildings, including a facility run by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections after a police officer shot\u00a0Jacob Blake \u2014 leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.\nIn sum, as of this writing exponentially more structures nationwide were damaged in connection to BLM protests in 2020 than the El Dorado fire, though the exact extent to the property damage (per the legal definition) during the demonstrations was unknown. For that reason, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "true_details": [["The blogger credit with start the \u201c gender reveal \u201d party more than 10 year ago be feed up with the way the trend have evolve \u2014 especially in light of news that a massive wildfire raging in California start because of one .", 79.123, 0, 59], ["After year of accident stem from gender-reveal party , the woman who be widely credit with start the trend have a new message for excited parents-to-be : \u201c Stop it .", 73.315, 0, 142], ["As far a I can tell , gender reveal party have cause more destruction than the protest about police brutality that have be happen this year .", 70.374, 0, 68], ["But gender and social expert have idea , some more abstract and some more tangible , that explain why these party have become more explosive and more destructive a time go on .", 66.918, 0, 103], ["In recent year , several large-scale party have go wrong , even result in the death of a woman in 2019 .", 66.695, 0, 78], ["To be clear , there be plenty of gender reveal party that never make headline and be no doubt enjoy by many people ; there wouldn \u2019 t be an industry around them if they weren \u2019 t so popular .", 66.076, 0, 102], ["\u201d\nIncluding men in a traditionally feminine space , like a celebration of pregnancy , could trigger masculinity loss , and this would partly explain why gender reveals have feature explosive , gun , wildfire , and bullet wound , while traditional baby shower didn \u2019 t .", 65.158, 0, 96], ["California have be see a surge in wildfire since Aug. 15 due to excessive heat and thunderstorm , accord to official .", 64.898, 0, 54], ["In October 2019 , a 56-year-old woman be kill when she be strike by fly debris from a device that be suppose to shoot plume of smoke at a gender-reveal party in Knoxville , Iowa , about 40 mile southeast of Des Moines .", 62.64, 0, 30], ["In October 2019 , a 56-year-old woman be kill when she be strike by fly debris from a device that be suppose to shoot plume of smoke at a gender-reveal party in Knoxville , Iowa , about 40 mile southeast of Des Moines .", 62.64, 0, 40]], "false_details": [["All that \u2019 s just a small snapshot of the manslaughter and mayhem unleash by gender reveal party over the last couple of year .", 34.426, 0, 70], ["Karvunidis , who live in California , say in a telephone interview that she have ash on her house from another wildfire that be burn in the Angeles National Forest northeast of Los Angeles .", 33.518, 0, 41], ["But give that people be risk social distancing measure in the middle of a pandemic and set off smoke bomb during wildfire season , it seem a though that plea will go unheeded .", 31.458, 0, 107], ["This isn \u2019 t the first time a gender reveal party have lead to catastrophe , and yet the celebration have only grow in popularity .", 30.122, 0, 50], ["A gender reveal photo shoot allegedly cause one of this weekend 's destructive wildfire in California , accord to firefighter .", 29.772, 1, 52], ["The family that use a pyrotechnic device during the party have '' absolutely be cooperate '' with official , Cal Fire Capt .", 29.673, 0, 92], ["Gender reveal party be a young tradition , and so they haven \u2019 t be study extensively and academically yet .", 29.377, 0, 105], ["While the incident in Arizona may be the first time a gender-reveal party have end in a wildfire and cause $ 8 million in damage , it isn \u2019 t the only occasion when the much-hyped reveal have take a strange , even disastrous turn .", 28.176, 0, 125], ["In October 2019 , a 56-year-old woman be kill when she be strike by fly debris from a device that be suppose to shoot plume of smoke at a gender-reveal party in Knoxville , Iowa , about 40 mile southeast of Des Moines .", 26.754, 0, 30], ["In October 2019 , a 56-year-old woman be kill when she be strike by fly debris from a device that be suppose to shoot plume of smoke at a gender-reveal party in Knoxville , Iowa , about 40 mile southeast of Des Moines .", 26.754, 0, 40]], "true_idx": [59, 142, 68, 103, 78, 102, 96, 54, 30, 40], "false_idx": [70, 41, 107, 50, 52, 92, 105, 125, 30, 40], "num_overlap": [10, 10, 18]}, "271528": {"claim": "Netflix CEO Kim Martin Morrow was arrested on child pornography charges.

Harris, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, also spoke to Blake himself over the phone as he recovered in hospital from his injuries. Details about their conversation spread on the internet and drew censure as social media users learned Blake had previously been accused of sexual assault.\nSnopes readers shared a Facebook post, asking if Harris had indeed told Blake \u2014 a man who had committed \u201crape,\u201d the meme claimed \u2014 that she was \u201cproud of him.\u201d\n\nThe post read: \u201cJust so women are clear \u2026 Kamala Harris went to see a man that raped a woman and told him she\u2019s proud of him!\u201d\nBlake was charged with third-degree sexual assault of his ex-girlfriend, but has not been tried or convicted. In July 2020, prosecutors in Kenosha, Wisconsin, successfully applied for an arrest warrant for Blake on charges of third-degree sexual assault, criminal trespass, and disorderly conduct, all of which were additionally designated as acts of domestic abuse. In Wisconsin, third-degree sexual assault is defined as: \u201cWhoever has sexual intercourse with a person without the consent of that person is guilty of a Class G felony.\u201d\nSnopes reported on Blake\u2019s sexual assault charges in more detail here. Since Blake has not been tried or convicted of the July 2020 charges, it is not yet known whether the Facebook post\u2019s claim that Blake \u201craped a woman\u201d is accurate.\nOn Aug. 23, 2020, the same woman who had filed the complaint against Blake that led to the sexual assault charges in July called 911 to report that Blake was at her home in Kenosha, according to interviews and records. Officials said that police responded to what they said was a domestic complaint and attempted to arrest Blake. Police initially attempted to use a Taser on him and also said Blake admitted to having a knife. Ben Crump, a lawyer for Blake\u2019s family denied that Blake was carrying a knife and said he had been trying to break up a disturbance involving two women. Police shot Blake seven times in the back in front of his children. A neighbor recorded the shooting with a cellphone. Protests spread across Kenosha in the aftermath. Blake\u2019s family said he was paralyzed from the waist down as a result of the shooting.\u00a0\nHarris visited Blake\u2019s family in early September and said she wanted to \u201cexpress concern for their well-being\u201d and \u201cto let them know that they have support.\u201d She added, \u201cthey\u2019re an incredible family and what they\u2019ve endured and they do it with such divinity and grace and you know they\u2019re carrying the weight of a lot of voices on their shoulders.\u201d Crump released a statement after Harris met the family and spoke to Blake on the phone.\nSen. @KamalaHarris met with the family of #JacobBlake today, who joined by phone from his hospital bed.

In August she told NBC News that there should be a thorough investigation and based on what she saw in the video of the shooting, \u201cthe officer should be charged.\u201d Harris added, \u201cin America, we know these cases keep happening. And we have had too many Black men in America who have been the subject of this kind of conduct.

In the months following, an unknown number of teenagers across the U.S. continued to participate in the digital dare, which is allegedly connected to the death of at least one teen and the hospitalization of three others, prompting warnings from health experts about the potential risk of overdose death. These warnings in turn prompted coverage by mainstream news media, which described teens\u2019 participation in the challenge \u2014 perhaps hyperbolically \u2014 as a \u201ctrend\u201d:\n\nInternet challenges refer to social media prompts that convince users to participate in some form of (oftentimes) dangerous activity, like biting into Tide brand laundry pods (\u201cTide Pod Challenge\u201d) or convincing children to disappear for 72 hours (\u201cMomo Challenge\u201d). Although some have been well-intended, like raising money for charitable causes, and others have been downright silly, many are a masquerade for some forms of cyberbullying.\nOthers are potentially deadly.\n\u201cThe Benadryl challenge is something that as parents, we need to be aware of these challenges and bring attention to how to properly use these products and make sure they are not accessible to teens. Those conversations need to explain the seriousness and long-lasting consequences of abusing products,\u201d Julie Weber, director of the Missouri Poison Center, told Snopes in an interview. Weber added that her facility saw an uptick in inquiries and online searches regarding Benadryl and diphenhydramine since the challenge was first initiated online. A majority of those who participate in the challenge are thought to be teenagers and young adults.\nBenadryl is an over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamine drug commonly used to treat allergies. Its key ingredient is diphenhydramine, which can be harmful in large amounts. It is also found in other OTC drugs like Nytol, Sominex, and Tylenol PM. Diphenhydramine works by blocking the histamine response in the body that causes an allergic reaction. In recommended doses, the chemical is not fatal and can cause subtle side effects like drowsiness or dry mouth, but when taken in excess, the drug can cause more serious symptoms like slurred speech and dystonic reaction that creates a stiff, rigid movement in the body.\nDiphenhydramine can also cause long-term harm or death when misused and abused. That\u2019s because an overdose can affect different parts of the body, according to the Mt. Sinai Health System in New York. Symptoms of overdose can include the inability to urinate, blurred vision, agitation and confusion, as well as hallucinations, seizures, depression, or nervousness, among others.\n\u201cWe really have a whole, wide range of toxicity,\u201d said Weber, adding that diphenhydramine overdose can also cause a person to have a dry mouth, feel flushed, and see increased body temperature.\nDiphenhydramine is considered an anticholinergic drug, which means that it works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that sends chemical messages between certain cells in the body. The urinary system is one that can be impacted by diphenhydramine overdose, resulting in urinary retention. This can slow down the intestines so that the body is not able to properly metabolize the drug, leading to further toxicity. At its most extreme, diphenhydramine overdose can disrupt the cardiac system and create an abnormal heart rhythm, which may lead to cardiac arrest.\u00a0\nJamie Favazza with the TikTok communications team told Snopes that the platform continued to remove \u201cextremely small numbers\u201d of new content related to the Benadryl challenge at least through September 2020. In an email, Favazza referred Snopes to the safety controls in the app as well as educational resources located in its safety center, and sent the following statement:\nThe safety and well-being of our users is TikTok\u2019s top priority. As we make clear in our Community Guidelines, we do not allow content that encourages, promotes, or glorifies dangerous challenges that might lead to injury. Though we have not seen this content trend on our platform, we actively remove content that violates our guidelines and block related hashtags to further discourage participation. We encourage everyone to exercise caution in their behavior whether online or off.\nBenadryl owner Johnson & Johnson wrote that the misuse of its drug can lead to serious side effects with \u201cpotentially long-lasting or even life-threatening consequences.\u201d\n\u201cWe understand that consumers may have heard about an online \u2018challenge\u2019 involving the misuse or abuse of diphenhydramine. The challenge, which involves [the] ingestion of excessive quantities of diphenhydramine, is a dangerous trend and should be stopped immediately. Benadryl products and other diphenhydramine products should only be used as directed by the label,\u201d noted the company, adding that \u201ccollaboration and education are critical to putting an end to this dangerous misuse.\u201d\nExperts advised parents and guardians to practice positive communication with their children and educate teenagers and young adults about the risks of diphenhydramine overdose, as well as monitor their social media accounts. If someone is thought to be overdosing, experts recommend having the following information handy while seeking professional medical assistance:\nFor severe symptoms, call 911 right away. If it is recommended that a person seek emergency medical attention, experts suggest bringing the drug container to the hospital. Recovery is likely if a person survives the first 24 hours and, though overdose is generally non-fatal, long-term complications may include brain damage and serious heart rhythm disturbances.\nFor more information on how to talk to children about over-the-counter medicine safety, visit the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) here.

Canadian border it stops \u2026 very little in comparison \u2026 then it resumes in Alaska\u201d:\n\nFor those who take such posts seriously, the simple answer is that fires don\u2019t stop at national borders, but many maps produced by U.S. agencies only display U.S.-derived data and thus don\u2019t reflect activity occurring across the border.\nBut western Canada did indeed also experience wildfires in 2020, as a map from the same time frame produced by a non-U.S. governmental agency, Natural Resources Canada showed fire hot spots on both sides of the border:\n\nIt was certainly true that wildfires were comparatively much more prevalent in the western U.S. than in western Canada in September 2020, a phenomenon that news accounts attributed to local weather and pandemic-related restrictions:\nAs wildfires turn the skies apocalyptic along the western seaboard of the United States, it has been a quieter-than-usual wildfire season in western Canada that can be attributed to the mixed blessings of rainy weather and isolating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cWhy are they [in the western U.S.] getting it and we are not? It\u2019s because of the weather they\u2019re getting,\u201d explains Mike Flannigan, a professor with the Department of Renewable Resources at the University of Alberta.\n\u201cThe warmer it gets, the longer the fire season,\u201d Flannigan explained.\nAlthough weather is a major factor in wildfires, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact in 2020. In Alberta, for example, the busiest time for fires is May, with many started by humans. But fire bans in Alberta and B.C., and off-highway vehicle bans in Alberta during the COVID lockdowns, helped to reduce the human element.\n\u201cThere were fewer people out and about working or recreating in the woods, so the number of caused fires was way down this year\u2026 Forest closures, quad bans, they work, they really work,\u201d [Flannigan] said.\nHot, dry, windy conditions are a deadly combination for the biggest fires, according to Flannigan. In the western United States, it has been hot and windy, and there has also been unusual lightning activity in places such as California.\nIn British Columbia and Alberta, a lot of rain has reduced much of the wildfire risk this season.
